 - (If you get errors, make sure PHP isn't horribly outdated)
 - Configure the style and any other settings in plotupload/config/configuration.php
 - Change the url in PlotSquared settings.yml
 - Test out /plot download

Benefits:
 - This can run on a different machine to your server
 - You can connect multiple servers to the same web interface
 
What this does not currently support:

 - Plot searching (request this feature if desired)
 
Notes:
 - If you are going to monetize this (e.g. for donators) please consider the amount of effort that has gone into PlotSquared; currently we get very little in terms of contributions.
